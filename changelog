April 8, 2020:

1. (line 114 of config.py)
Changed the tree-generation timestepping to min(0.06, 0.1tdyn) Gyr, because
my exploration of timestepping in DASH indicates that the mass-loss model
converges at around this timestep. The "stripping efficiency" parameter also
converges to a fixed value for timesteps at or below ~0.06 Gyr.

2. (copied SatEvo.py to SubEvo.py)
Will be doing my model in SubEvo.py, which aims to just do NFW-only subhalo
evolution modeling.




TODO:
1. Change lines 174 and 175 of TreeGen.py to work with the Jiang+15 pdfs
2. Figure out if the masses/radii are virial or 200c, and how the DASH results
will be impacted by this.
3. Figure out how to work with the multiple levels of substructure and what to
use for the host halo mass
4. Figure out how the tree structure works
